### Deployment

You can deploy this project using one of the following hosting.

While we have been using GitHub Pages to deploy our static webpages till now, and we can definitely continue to do so with hacky ways, it’s far easier to let a PaaS (Platform as a Service) do the same for us! There are a lot of options to host such sites, and the Vite hosting docs go over the most popular ones among them.

Not only do some of these get rid of additional steps after pushing our code to GitHub as these services have tools that automatically deploy on push, but you also don’t have to worry about other issues further down the curriculum, like routers and build steps. We shall use a few selected options for now. Once you are done with the assignment, choose one of the following options, and deploy!

* **GitHub Pages:**
    * GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that is integrated with GitHub. It allows you to host your static website directly from your GitHub repository.
    * To deploy your React app to GitHub Pages, you will need to create a new repository and initialize it with a `README.md` file. Then, you will need to create a `public/` directory in the root of your repository and place your React app files in that directory. Finally, you will need to add a `CNAME` file to the root of your repository and specify the domain name where you want to deploy your website.
    * Once you have made these changes, you can push your changes to GitHub and your website will be deployed automatically.

* **Netlify:**
    * Netlify is another popular static site hosting service. It offers a number of features that make it easy to deploy and manage your React app, such as automatic build and deploy, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and staging environments.
    * To deploy your React app to Netlify, you will need to create an account and connect your GitHub repository. Then, you will need to select the repository that contains your React app and click on the "Deploy" button. Netlify will then build and deploy your app automatically.

* **Vercel:**
    * Vercel is another popular static site hosting service that is specifically designed for React apps. It offers a number of features that make it easy to deploy and manage your React app, such as automatic build and deploy, preview environments, and performance optimization.
    * To deploy your React app to Vercel, you will need to create an account and connect your GitHub repository. Then, you will need to select the repository that contains your React app and click on the "Deploy" button. Vercel will then build and deploy your app automatically.

Once you have deployed your React app to one of these platforms, you will be able to access it at the URL that is provided by the platform.
